# NgFeaturePagination

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Pagination NPM Packages

- [jw angular pagination](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jw-angular-pagination)
- [ngx pagination](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-pagination)

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. To begin, add the `angular-cli-ghpages` builder.

```bash
ng add angular-cli-ghpages
```

2. If you’re deploying the project to a Github project page you’ll need to set the `baseHref` property as the repository name. The `baseHref` will be used for all relative URLs on your site. You could specify the `baseHref` as part of the project architect deploy options in the `angular.json` file. Or just pass it as the `--base-href` flag to the `ng deploy` command. If you’re deploying the project to a Github user page, you do not need to set this option.

```bash
ng deploy --base-href=/<repository-name>/
```

GitHub will automatically enable Pages when you push a gh-pages branch. There is no need to enable Pages from the repository settings.

```bash
ng deploy --base-href=/ng-feature-pagination/
```
